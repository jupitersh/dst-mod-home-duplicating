# Home Duplicating

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

The mod allows you to duplicate your home from one server to another server.

And it can duplicate your home in the same server, too.

**Usage**

type the following commands to excute it in the chatting window:

**`+record`**

You should add a number as the a side length of a square. For example, `+record5` mean that you will set a square area whose center is your character's location and whose side length is `5`. System will record every structure and plant inside the square area and will record the tile, too.

**`+deploy`**

Just type `+deploy` in the chatting window, system will automatically deploy the square area as you previously recorded. The square area center is also the location of your character.

**`+wipe`**

You should add a number as the a side length of a square. `+record5` mean that you will set a square area whose center is your character's location and whose side length is `5`. System will remove every structure and plant inside the square area. **Use it with caution.**

BTW, the center of the square area is not exactly the character's location. It is the cross point of tile which is the closest to the location of your character.
